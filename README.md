# Slackbot API Scripts for Delegate and Voter Notifications
A set of algorithms to anlayze the blockchain and provide Slack notifications.

Currently the script is focused on notifying delegates and voters of missed blocks. Future plans include:

- Enhanced pool list responses with current rank and recent productivity statistics.
- Blockchain metric responses. (Block Height, inactive "red" nodes, consensus, etc.)
